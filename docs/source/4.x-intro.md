# What's new in Gluu Server v4

## Version 4.2

### OpenID Connect FAPI Certification

Financial-grade APIs are REST APIs that provide JSON data representing sensitive data. These APIs are protected by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework. Start in Version 4.2, the Gluu Server supports FAPI and has been certified by OpenID. See more information in the [docs](./admin-guide/fapi-ciba.md) and the [spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-ID2.html).

### Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication
The Gluu Server now supports CIBA. OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow is an authentication flow like OpenID Connect. However, unlike OpenID Connect, there is direct Relying Party to OpenID Provider communication without redirects through the user's browser. CIBA enables a Client to initiate the authentication of an end-user by means of out-of-band mechanisms. For more information, check the [docs](./admin-guide/ciba.md) and the [spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0-ID1.html).

### Support for OpenID Back-Channel Logout

The Gluu Server now supports back-channel logout, using direct back-channel communication betweeh the OP and RPs being logged out without requiring input from the User Agent. See the [docs](./operation/logout.md#back-channel-logout) and [spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html#BCRequest).

### New Interception Scripts

In 4.2, we've introduced new interception scripts for Post-Authentication Authorization ([more details](./admin-guide/custom-script.md#post-authn)), UMA2 RPT claims ([more details](./admin-guide/custom-script.md#uma-2-rpt-claims)), and application session management ([more details](./admin-guide/custom-script.md#application-session-management)).

### Deployment Changes

#### SCIM is now a separate component in the Gluu Server

Starting in Version 4.2, SCIM has been separated into its own [Gluu Server component](https://github.com/GluuFederation/community-edition-setup/issues/651). Installation is now optional when setting up a new server. See the [docs](./api-guide/scim-api.md) for more information.

### Jackrabbit Support for Kubernetes Deployments
The Kubernetes deployment of the Gluu Server 4.2 now includes support for the [Jackrabbit](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/jcr/index.html) Java Content Repository for persistence of oxAuth custom files, oxShibboleth IDP files, Casa and oxTrust custom files. This is most useful in larger deployments. See the [docs](./installation-guide/install-kubernetes.md#working-with-jackrabbit).

### FIDO U2F and FIDO 2 Security Key Consolidation

The FIDO2 Interception Script now handles both U2F and FIDO2 keys using a separate component in the Gluu Server. The U2F script is still available, but will be deprecated in future versions.

### Non-Backwards-Compatible Changes

#### New JSON Properties

The following properties were implemented in 4.2 to help upgrading customers maintain past behavior:

| New Behavior | Issue Number | JSON Property|
| --- | --- | --- |
| `response_type` and `grant type` are no longer added to client by default | [#1252](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/issues/1252) | `clientRegDefaultToCodeFlowWithRefresh` |
| `client_secret` is no longer returned on client read | [#1053](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/issues/1053) | `returnClientSecretOnRead` |
| The `offline_access` scope is now required to use the `refresh_token` grant type | [#1172](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/issues/1172) | `forceOfflineAccessScopeToEnableRefreshToken` |
| The Authorization endpoint no longer uses `session_id` by default | [#1195](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/issues/1195) | `sessionIdRequestParameterEnabled` |
| The `reason` field is no longer returned in error responses by default | [#1344](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/issues/1344) | `errorReasonEnable` |


## Version 4.1

### OIDC client creation improvements

In version 4.1, we fixed several issues with OpenID Connect clients that were causing early expiration and errors with attributes.

### Shibboleth IDP cache support
Shibboleth IDP user sessions are now cached similarly to other services, allowing them to survive server restarts and be more easily replicated in a clustered environment. See more details in the [IDP documentation](./admin-guide/saml.md#idp-cache-support)

### Casa and oxd added to installation script
For convenience, [Casa](https://gluu.org/docs/casa) and [oxd](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd) can now be installed with the standard Community Edition setup script! See all the options in the [setup script documentation](./installation-guide/setup_py.md).

### Minor bug fixes and feature improvements

A variety of bug fixes and UX improvements are included with the latest release. See our [complete release notes](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/4.1/release-notes/#changes).

## Version 4.0

### Persistence redesign
In 4.0, the Gluu Server persistence layer is more modular. Previously LDAP was tightly bundled. Now, any persistence mechanism can be supported with a jar file that implements the base Persistence API. The desired mechanism can then be specifed in `gluu.properties`. [Learn more](./reference/persistence.md).   

### Support for Couchbase 
Couchbase Enterprise Edition (EE) is now supported as a persistence mechanism, enabling hyper-scalable authentication and authorization. [Learn more](https://gluu.org/docs/cb). 

### Extensive Passport redesign
New UI's in 4.0 enable simpler configuration of inbound identity workflows and improved support for external OpenID Connect Providers ("inbound OpenID"). [Read the docs](./authn-guide/passport.md).

### No version numbers in packages
Previously, the version number was included in the Gluu Server package, e.g. `gluu-server-3.1.6`. Starting in 4.0, the latest stable Gluu Server package name is simply `gluu-server`. This simplifies version upgrades, server operations, and improves interoperability between Gluu products.

### More SAML IDP features
NameIDs can now be [configured inside oxTrust](./admin-guide/saml.md#configure-nameid-in-oxtrust), and [SAML ACRS parameters](./admin-guide/saml.md#authncontextclassref-support) are now supported, which, when used in conjunction with [force authentication](./admin-guide/saml.md#force-authentication), enables stepped-up authentication for SAML SPs. 

### Support for RADIUS authentication
The Gluu Server now supports two options for RADIUS authentication to enable SSO and 2FA to non-web applications like SSH, VPN, and Wi-Fi: 

- [Gluu RADIUS](./admin-guide/radius-server/gluu-radius.md): a free, single-threaded RADIUS implementation based on the TinyRADIUS server; and...  

- [Radiator](./admin-guide/radius-server/gluu-radiator.md): a robust, commercial AAA server built for ISPs and carriers.

### Improved clean up service
Introduced in CE 3.1.6, `cleanService` is now more configurable. This service periodically removes unused and expired cache and session-related database entries to improve server performance. [Read the docs](./operation/cleanup.md).

### Updated libraries and components 
4.0 includes the latest version of Shibboleth, updated Java libraries and Jetty, and Oracle JDK has been replaced with Amazon Corretto, an open source, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. 

### Minor bug fixes and feature improvements
A variety of bug fixes and UX improvements are included with the latest release. See our [complete release notes](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/4.0/release-notes/#changes).
